        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <p>Marinating Mutton: In a large bowl, combine mutton pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala, and salt. Mix well, cover, and let it marinate for at least 2-3 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>Cooking Rice: Boil soaked basmati rice in a large pot of water with salt and whole spices until it's 70-80% cooked. The grains should still have a slight bite to them. Drain the water and set aside.</p>
        <p>Preparing Biryani Masala:In a pan, heat ghee and oil. Add chopped mint and coriander leaves. Saute for a minute. Add biryani masala and mix well. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>Layering Biryani: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a heavy-bottomed pan, layer half of the partially cooked rice. Place the marinated mutton over the rice. Sprinkle half of the fried onions and half of the biryani masala mixture. Add the remaining rice on top, followed by the remaining fried onions and biryani masala mixture. Drizzle saffron-soaked milk over the top.</p>
        <p>Dum Cooking (Oven Method): Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil or a lid. Place it in the preheated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the mutton to cook completely.</p>
        <p>Serve: Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact. Serve the Mutton Biryani hot, garnished with additional fried onions and fresh coriander leaves.</p>
