        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <p>Prepare Paneer:

            Boil the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan.
            Add lemon juice or vinegar to curdle the milk.
            Once the curds separate, strain them through a muslin cloth.
            Rinse the paneer under cold water to remove any trace of lemon or vinegar.
            Knead the paneer until it becomes smooth and soft.</p>
        <p>Shape and Cook Dumplings:

            Add all-purpose flour and baking soda (if using) to the paneer. Knead again.
            Divide the mixture into small, equal-sized portions and shape them into flat discs.
            In a separate pan, bring water to a boil. Add a little sugar.
            Gently drop the paneer discs into the boiling water and cook for about 10-12 minutes.
            Once cooked, remove them and place in cold water.</p>
        <p>Prepare Sugar Syrup:

            In another pot, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup.
            Add saffron strands and cardamom powder.
            Bring the syrup to a boil, ensuring the sugar dissolves completely.
            Allow it to cool slightly.</p>
        <p>Soak Paneer Dumplings:

            Gently squeeze out the excess water from the cooked paneer dumplings.
            Place them in the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 2-3 hours.</p>
        <p>Prepare Rabri:

            Boil milk in a wide, heavy-bottomed pan.
            Add sugar, saffron strands, and cardamom powder.
            Simmer on low heat, stirring frequently until the milk reduces to half its original volume.</p>
        <p>Assemble Rasamalai:

            Take a serving dish and place the soaked paneer dumplings in it.
            Pour the reduced milk (rabri) over the dumplings.
            Garnish with chopped nuts.</p>

        <p>Chill and Serve:

            Refrigerate the Rasamalai for a few hours before serving.
            Serve chilled and enjoy the creamy goodness!</p>
