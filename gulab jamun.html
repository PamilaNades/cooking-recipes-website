        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <p>Prepare Dough:

            In a mixing bowl, crumble the khoya.
            Add all-purpose flour, baking soda, and ghee to the crumbled khoya.
            Knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. If it's too dry, add a little milk as needed.</p>
        <p>Shape into Balls:

            Divide the dough into small, smooth balls. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface.</p>
        <p>Heat Ghee or Oil:

            Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</p>
        <p>Fry the Balls:

            Once the ghee or oil is hot, reduce the heat to low-medium.
            Carefully add the prepared gulab jamun balls to the hot ghee.
            Fry them until they turn golden brown, turning them gently for even cooking.
            Remove and place them on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.</p>
        <p>Prepare Sugar Syrup:
            In a separate pan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup.
            Bring it to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.
            Add cardamom powder, saffron strands (if using), and rose water.
            Simmer the syrup for 5-7 minutes until it attains a slightly sticky consistency.</p>
        <p>Soak in Sugar Syrup:

            Drop the fried gulab jamun balls into the warm sugar syrup.
            Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours to absorb the sweetness.</p>

        <p>Serve:

            Once soaked, Gulab Jamun is ready to be served.</p>
